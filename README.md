# Browsers-automation
Some automation webpages scripts I created with Selenium.
Most of them for personal use, but you might find them usful also for you.

To use those scripts you have to:
1. Install Python 3.7+
2. Install Selenium Package with pip install or from this site: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html
3. Download Chromedriver that matches your browser version from here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
and move it to the main directory.
