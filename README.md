# Browsers-automation
A mix of webpages automation scripts I created with Selenium, some of them are really basic and some are more advanced.
I created them for personal use, but you might find them usful also for you.

To use those scripts you have to:
1. Install Python 3.7+
2. Install Selenium Package with pip install or from this site: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html
3. Download Chromedriver that matches your browser version from here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
and move it to the main directory.
